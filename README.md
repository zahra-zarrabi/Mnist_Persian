# Mnist_Persian Classifier
We proposed a CNN network for Mnist Persian classification. We used framework pytorch==1.8.2.
## Dataset
MNIST persian image dataset includes a training set of 960 samples and a test set of 240 samples. Each sample is resized to 70*70 pixels on a RGB associated with a tag of 10 classes.
